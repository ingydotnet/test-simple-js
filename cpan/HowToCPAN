Overview of the JS-Test-Simple CPAN distribution.

The 'cpan/' subdirectory of David Wheeler's Test.Simple JSAN module has
been set up to be a CPAN module directory for the module JS-Test-Simple.

The idea was to leave the JSAN code (nearly) intact and unchanged,
while, at the same time (using the same files), set up a module
distribution of the code for CPAN.

Much of this setup is accomplished by using symlinks to connect the
stuff above (JSAN) to the stuff below (CPAN).

The following details the basic file layout of this directory:

- Changes - symlink to ../Changes
- MANIFEST - generated by 'make manifest'
- MANIFEST.SKIP - files to ignore in the MANIFEST
- Makefile.PL - A Module::Install based make-maker script.
- README - symlink to ../README
- lib/ - JS and Perl source files. The files are all symlinks to above.
- t/test.t - One very simple Perl test
- tests/ - Same JavaScript test suite as ../tests/

The JavaScript Modules and docs are all symlinked:
- lib/JS/Test/Builder.js -> ../lib/Test/Builder.js
- lib/JS/Test/Builder.pod -> ../doc/pod/Test/Builder.pod
- lib/JS/Test/Harness.js -> ../lib/Test/Harness.js
- lib/JS/Test/Harness.pod -> ../doc/pod/Test/Harness.pod
- lib/JS/Test/More.js -> ../lib/Test/More.js
- lib/JS/Test/More.pod -> ../doc/pod/Test/More.pod
- lib/JS/Test/Simple.js -> ../lib/Test/Simple.js
- lib/JS/Test/Simple.pod -> ../doc/pod/Test/Simple.pod
etc ...

There is one Perl module, which is really just a POD file turned into a
dummy Perl module: JS::Test::Simple. A Perl module is needed so that
other CPAN dists can depend on this dist as a prerequisite:
- lib/JS/Test/Simple.pm -> ../doc/pod/Test/Simple.pod

The tests/ directory just has two entries:
- tests/lib/ - Symlinks to all the code modules needed by the tests.
- tests/Makefile - A Makefile to set up the tests directory.

To make all the tests do this command:

   make -C tests/

The .js test files are symlinked from '../tests/'. The .html test files
are copied from '../tests/' and tweaked slightly by the Makefile to
point to the correct paths for loading JS modules.

                        == How To Make a CPAN Release ==

This part of the text is the instructions for releasing Test.Simple to
CPAN as JS-Test-Simple.

NOTE: Please update these instructions with any extra steps you
      encounter that are not detailed (or detailed improperly) here.

1) cd into this directory. (openjsan/users/theory/Test.Simple/trunk/cpan)
2) Make your coding changes

Almost all the files in the cpan/ directory are symlinks, so you can edit
the symlinks safely (and be updating the correct files).

3) Update the Changes file
4) Update the version #s to the new release version

I run this command (where 0.24 is the previous release):

    vim `find .. -type f | xargs grep -l '0\.24'`

5) Review tests/Makefile for accuracy (if you've add new JSAN tests)
6) make -C tests/
7) 'svn add' for new files
8) Run these commands:

    > perl Makefile.PL
    > make test
    > rm MANIFEST
    > make manifest

9) Make sure all the Perl tests pass
10) Review the MANIFEST file
11) Run the tests/ suite in browsers
12) Run the ../tests/ JSAN suite in browsers
13) Run 'make dist' command
14) Upload the new tarball to CPAN:

    > cpan-upload -user CPANID -password ******** JS-Test-Simple-0.25.tar.gz

15) make purge
16) cd ..
17) svn commit
